      <h1 class="about-me-header">Hi There,</h1>
      <p class="about-me-paragraph">My name's Ivan. I am a budding full stack software developer with a background in computer hardware. Ever since I can remember, I've been fascinated with technology. My love for video gaming as a child led me to become enamored by the idea of building a gaming PC, and by winter of '07 I had built my first machine. After college, I got a job repairing PCs including laptops and AIO systems. This greatly expanded my knowledge of various computer hardware and troubleshooting in general. From here, I was promoted to a new department: server rack integration. In this department, I have performed many roles and duties, but am now in charge of running custom scripts on racks to validate and configure hardware and software settings, install any customer images, and compile results. Again, this position taught me an incredible amount about other peices of hardware such as servers, switches, and storage devices. With a hunger for knowledge and a lack of a clear path forward in hardware, I decided to work towards a career in software development. I have been attending NSS for around 5 months now and have loved every bit of it. Building things in software has been an exhilarating and rewarding eperience and I couldn't be more excited to continue to learn and expand my toolbox.</p>
